## 4th of June: Ideation.
I'm honestly so hyped for this project and today was all about spending some time consolidating this hype into actual features to implement onto a keyboard. After watching a bunch of long Youtube videos on the topic, notably Christian Selig's ["I Built My Dream Keyboard from Absolute Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UXsD7nSfDY&t=1179s) and Modern Hobbyist's underrated ["I Built My DREAM Keyboard from SCRATCH (and it's modular)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwFWBdfZKnI), I had a good idea of things I wanted in my keyboard, what I really did not want and also some pretty clever tools I can use in the process.

So in terms of layout and size, I've decided to stick to a QWERTY layout (boring, I know, but I use my laptop keyboard a ton and don't want to learn the ins and outs of a completely custom layout) on a 65%-ish keyboard. In the Zetaboard, I want to do away with some of the keys I've basically never used, or intend to in the future. And, to increase productivity, I'm going to be integrating a Pomodoro timer into the keyboard. TL;DR, these are my main features:

- Hot swappable MX switches
- 65% + a few knobs (get rid of never-used keys)
- Inbuilt pomodoro timer (special key and layer for it)
- RGB, or some form of backlighting
- Wireless
- Vertically tilted slightly, so that each key is slightly above the one below (ergonomics)

I got into Keyboard Layout Editor, to do up a quick visual of what I have in mind. It'll look something like this.

I've added a special Zeta key which will used to trigger a layer for the Pomodoro timer and other keyboard related actions.

I've gotta start looking for some parts now...

**Total time spent:** 3h
